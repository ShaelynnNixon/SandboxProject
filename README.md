## üîÆ Future Plans

This project began as a practical scheduling tool, but I plan to evolve it into something much more powerful:

- **AI-Powered Scheduling**: Integrate machine learning to automatically generate the most efficient schedule based on business needs, employee availability, preferences, and historical trends.
- **Smart Prioritization**: Use AI to fairly distribute shifts, reduce overtime, and adapt to changing staffing patterns.
- **Web Dashboard**: Build a clean UI for managers to review, adjust, and publish schedules.
- **Dynamic Shift Support**: Allow variable shift lengths and overlapping shifts for more realistic coverage.
- **Employee Portal**: Let team members submit availability, request time off, and view schedules in real time.
- **Predictive Insights**: Suggest optimal staffing levels for busy days based on sales and traffic data (if available).
- **Notifications**: Automatically notify employees of assigned shifts via email or SMS.

Long term, I want this project to grow into a smart, user-friendly scheduling assistant that helps both managers and employees ‚Äî especially in fast-paced environments like retail or food service.
